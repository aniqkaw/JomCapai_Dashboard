Good Day Dr. Salimah,

First of all, I would like to thank you for a wonderful semester even it's fully online. Frankly speaking, I never would imagined that I would be taking my Master in such conditions as I am the person who like to social around in the campus, ""lepak dgn member-member"". It was very tough at start as the briefing of postgraduate is cancelled and we received limited support from university on how to access Spectrum, teams using siswamail, as well as subject registration. Online class did provide more convenience and ßexibility, however, it also make us easier to procrastinate especially when I am busy on my work.

I really appreciated your caring disposition and teaching style. The various interactive quizzes such as Kahoot you introduced in this course is very interesting as it refresh and strengthen our knowledge based on previous lecture. Through this course, I learnt about basic of data science process and programming in R especially the storytelling part will definitely help me to create a more insightful dashboard for my work.

I am really sorry Dr for being procrastinate for you class (still haven submit few tutorial and soft kills 😞 ) even you always remind us ""Do Not Procrastinate!, do your work as early as possible"". Thank you for your care in looking at each student’s grade individually and your generosity. I apologize and promise I will improve myself by having better time management. I hope I still sempat to catch up if I done all those by today.

Thank you so much for your time and patience. I am usually very very anxious about approaching professors, but you make things very simple, we can just ask anything in the WhatsApp group and you even reply us in no time.

Time flies, we are on our lockdown then suddenly 2021 and now this semester had came to an end. I hope that soon this
 
pandemic of Covid-19 can be ended as we shall meet one day in the campus. Lastly, a special thanks to my groupmates, Naim, Kent and Kam Yin who have been helping me along this course. Hope all of us will get a good grade!

For the reason purposely, I enrolling this programme is, I’m looking for the structured data science programme. Lucky on me, got you as my first semester’s lecturer for Principles of Data Science course. The materials, tutorials, assignments and assessments that you provided for us are more than complete.

What can I say, you’re the very most interactive and insightful educator and has strong desire to care deeply about the students and work hard to make sure no one is left behind. Still remember when you were attacked by vertigo, all of us did pray for your health condition. At that time, we don’t want to get any replacement lecturer if the faculty offer. Just pray to make sure your speedy recovery and continue to teach us. You did come back and teach us as usual. Appreciate your struggle.

As a lecturer as well, your encouragement and persistence for my learning process in this semester has taught me that I’m not a good educator. I’m capable, but it will take hard work and lots dedication to be like you. I earnestly feel that without your dedicated and strict mode while you teach us, I would not be able to follow the learning track.

As a new international student from China in the field of data science, this course is the door for me to step into this field, and the professor is the key to open this door and gave me a preliminary understanding of data science. In fact, this is my first semester in UM. Because I am a beginner in data science and have language problems, I have always been particularly worried that this course will not be learned well. This is also a very big challenge for me. I also felt a lot of pressure.

Although we have been taking classes online due to the epidemic, the guidance given to us by the professor has not diminished at all. We have clearly planned our weekly tutorial, quiz, mid-term and end-of-term, etc., all of which can train us and let us gain more A lot of knowledge related to data science. Among these links, I think the weekly quiz is the most interesting, because it allows us to have a review effect on the knowledge we learned last week. I still have many shortcomings in data science, and I still need to spend time to learn.

The professor has been teaching us very carefully. I saw the professor in the hospital some time ago. I hope that the professor can pay attention to your health in the future!
Although we are far apart now, thank you very much for your teaching and help to all of us this semester!

Before joining this course, I already had work experience as a data mining engineer in a world-leading company. Initially, I thought it might be a boring course because various concepts, techniques, tools, and so forth are not new to me. But from my current perspective, it is beneficial to me from at least three aspects.

Firstly, the content is well-organized and focused. From my previous job, I came across 3 types of questions:
1.	Where is the start and end of a data science project?
2.	What are the differences among similar terms?
3.	How to improve yourself?

For question 1, different people have a different understanding. Previously, my focuses are on data, different state-of-the-art models, and so forth. But now based on the data science process from this course, I gradually realized the significance of good questions and data storytelling. Also, since this course covers the data science methodology  and  introduces  each part, now I can identify and distinguish different confusing terms like data cleaning and data preparation. Finally, my original concentration is machine learning. But from this course, not only do I realize the importance of statistics, computer skills, and communication, but also I sense my interest is to be a data scientist rather than a data mining engineer.

Secondly, highly think of the vibrant interactions in the WhatsApp group and a wide selection of course reviews. Through a variety of communications, I could learn from my classmate while various ways of course reviews help me identify the weaknesses and strengths. Thanks to them, my entire learning process is satisfactory and pleasant without any difficulties.

Lastly, appreciate individual assignments and group assignments. As most of them are open, it encourages me to search for some suitable resources and grasp different tools. Although it is not pretty challenging to me, I do learn tremendously from my partners while my English levels in terms of listening, speaking, reading, and writing, have been improved especially considering my mother language is Chinese.

Here I propose one recommendations for this course and anticipate it benefits more incoming students. Don’t want to offend Dr and honestly I enjoy this course, instead. As Python becomes more and more popular, I recommend Dr also allows students to use Python for their assignments. Taking China as an example, there might a pretty limited number of people using R now and this strategy may be helpful for some international students to look for their jobs in the future.

Thanks to Dr and my classmates.

Good Evening Dr, when I first enrolled the data science programme, the thought I always have for mastering data science is we need a strong programming background or ßuent logic.

The pledge that we need to write inspired me and reßect what is important for the data science.
Also, appreciate the projects (R shiny app or data visualization tool) that are given so we are exposed to more technical skills that I never tried before. It is really interesting when I discovered more functions of the tools to be used!
Appreciate Dr's effort in the exit tickets and also the weekly quiz as they are really helpful in recalling or explore more the lessons or topics.

You are one of the lecturers who minimally missed out WhatsApp queries. It is understandable, the online learning mode is new for most of us and prone to lots of miscommunication. Staring at the computer screen throughout the day would have drained your energy. Yet, you were energetic during the class. So, as student of first batch taking 4 other subjects, I wouldn't say we had big miscommunication issues. Just that if it was a face-to-face class, it would have been easier to clarify words that we feel ambiguous during assessments. However, instead of normal paper-based tests, whatever we did in the class was more problem-based and involved critical thinking. The group assignments gave me a new bunch of valuable friends and knowledge on application building. Thanks to COVID-19 for that. May your genuine care help future batches to refine their career goals. May God bless you with energy and health. Have a good rest after every class.
